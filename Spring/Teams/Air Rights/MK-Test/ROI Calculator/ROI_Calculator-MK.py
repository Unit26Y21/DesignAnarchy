### 1. Research what is a back of the envelope pro forma (or a simple ROI)
    #Back of envelope is a rough estimate that filters out less desirable deals
### 2 . Write a series of python functions that take inputs used to calculated value and return you a simple ROI .###

#Investment = 40000
Rent = 700
Loss = 1000

#defining ROI as a rudimentary gauge of an investmentâ€™s profitability

ROI (Investment, Rent, Loss)

#Rate of Return- takes into account the project's time frame
#SROI- Social return on investment, to understand the environmental,
#   social and governance (ESG) criteria used in Socially responsible Investing (SRI)
