# TOWERS IN THE SOUP

## Site Selection: Dyckman 
#### The Dyckman NYCHA site is located in Inwood Manhattan, and is an optimal site for a proof of concept intervention that will be focused on ecological based improvements that will protect the land and residents from future natural disasters and flooding, and increasing available housing, while enhancing the community.

#### Dyckman was selected as the site for intervention, after analyzing all NYCHA sites in Manhattan and Brooklyn based on a list of key criteria to our team (in priority order): 
#### 1. Impacted by projected sea level rise and in the flood plain 
#### 2. <15% of site is covered by buildings 
#### 3. <50% of ground is impervious 
#### 4. <1000 ft to a subway; <1000 ft to parks
#### 5. Has parking on site 
#### 6. In a mixed income neighborhoodd

## Considered but not Recommended: 
#### The following sites were also considered in this analysis. Baruch Houses was a top contender in this analysis, and has a very similar site and demographic make up. However, Baruch Houses is a much larger site, with complex surroundings -- i.e. the FDR and East River. Dyckman is a similar site but on a smaller scale, that we suspect will provide the opportunity to more aggressive interventions. By proving out our interventions on a smaller scale site (dealing with Harlem River Drive and the Harlem River, opposed to the FDR Drive and the East River), it will be a proof of concept project that other NYCHA sites can adapt.

## VALUE PROPOSITION 

#### This intervention will be focused on helping the economically vulnerable population by providing new housing and also housing security from future natural disasters.  

#### The Dyckman NYCHA site is projected to be impacted by sea level rises in the next 50 years, and is in the projected flood zone where the whole site will be submerged by water during tropical storms and hurricanes. An aggressive, ecological intervention on this site will provide insurance to the current and future residents, and surrounding community that will benefit from this development.

#### In addition to ecological based interventions, the NYCHA site only has 13% of the land covered by buildings, leaving a huge opportunity for additional development that will increase the housing capacity. Given the amount of open space and proximity to the Harlem River, potential interventions include:

#### 1. TRANSFORM THE COASTLINE
####    - Thicken the water edge of the seawall to be like the mucky tidal wetlands & provide a buffer zone of breakwaters and relieve structures during storm surges
####    - Use landfill to extend the coast to create a saltwater marsh, to increase the length of the shore 

#### 2. SHIFT FROM HARD TO SOFT INFRASTRUCTURE 
####    - Transform material of streets and sidewalks to have them paved with cast concrete and incorporate plants and vegetation that are selected for their tolerance to pollution and saltwater
####    - The porus green streets will act as a sponge for rainwater in a new organic system designed to respond to tidal flows and storm surges 

#### 3. SLOW THE FLOW 
####    - Incorporate both blue and green roofs to hold water (blue roofs) to slow drainage (green roofs)
####    - Create vertical green facades to slow the flow of water

#### 4. TAME THE WAVE AND "ENRICH ESTUARINE HEALTH"  
####    - Restore shoals and oyster beds to act as a breakwater and diminish wave action, while also cleaning polluted waters 
####    - The new reef will protect the shoreline, where there is now a new, cleaner, water-based community with gardens thawt are fertilized with combined sewer overflow and oyster development industries, where residents savor homegrow shellfish
